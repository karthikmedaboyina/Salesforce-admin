This project report outlines the development of a Library Management System (LMS) built on Salesforce, a leading cloud-based platform widely used to manage data and automate business processes.
The primary objective of the system is to simplify and automate routine library operations that are traditionally handled manually. The LMS supports:
•	Tracking book availability and issue status in real time
•	Streamlining the book issuance and return process
•	Automatically calculating fines for overdue returns
•	Generating clear, interactive reports and dashboards to monitor library usage
Designed with user-friendliness in mind, the application is intuitive even for users with no prior Salesforce or technical experience. It functions like a smarter, automated version of familiar tools such as Excel or Google Sheets—minimizing manual errors, saving time, and making library management more efficient and organized for librarians, members, and administrators alike.
